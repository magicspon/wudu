# Wudu Trees

This site is built using data from GraphCMS. NextJS is used to generate a static build. Tailwind for styling

## Getting started

Create a `.env` file, add the graphcms api keys

Install the dependencies, either `npm install` or `yarn`. I suggest `yarn`

## To run the site

```
npm run dev
```
